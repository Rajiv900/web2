    I am Rajiv Shrestha, a first-year bachelor student in the faculty of 
BSC(Hons)Computing (software engineering) , Northampton University.
My University has been my first choice because I believe that it 
as the ability to provide me with quality education.
When it was finally the time to head back to the college,
 I hoped for everything to go on smoothly, just as how I expected it.
Firstly the expereince of learning the basic of web development ,coding 
it begin with nervousness and excited becausce it was the first day of college
it was responsible for the new students, to inquire about my classroom. 
being instructed on which room to go to, I started walking towards the
class, the mixture of excitement and nervousness start to fill within me.
Iâ€™m looking forward with great anticipation to the challenges that studying.
Now about the Teachers that feel appreciated and valued are willing to give forth 
effort and dedication.  Developing a vision for the school that the
teachers can buy in and get excited about with have them wanting to 
return to work. All which involve creating work environment, working 
with people, educational development of students.One of the most
 beneficial aspects of feedback is the information the teacher
 acquires. Through effective, teachers can determine the 
learning preference of individual students, the strengths and weaknesses 
in a given area, and information to help guide instruction. Students will 
experience more achievement as teachers use feedback to help direct their 
instructional practice.<br><br><br><br><br>
